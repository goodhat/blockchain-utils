## How to use?
1. Modify `ETHERSCAN_APIKEY=YOUR_API_KEY`.
2. Run `python3 main.py`
3. The program will prompt to let you enter the contract you want to download.
4. Finally, it will generate a folder contains all the files.

This tool relies on etherscan. The contract must have verified source code. Otherwise the program will fail. Notice that this tool does not have proper error handling.
